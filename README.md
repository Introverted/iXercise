# iXercise WebAPP
Project for INF132

Newest version of the iXercise WebAPP, this contains the server.

So from the BitSync, get all of the folders [except the js folder] and put them in your own project folder. The folders in the 
BitSync where too much to put here and we are not changing those at all, it just contains all the stuff to make the website look
pretty and other things.

This repo has only the files with the code that we are altering.
In the js folder the functions.js file is the only one you will alter. 

Once you have everything in one project folder do this:

1. make sure node.js is installed in your computer [to test try the other steps to see if it works]
2. run cmd
3. go to the project folder
4. run >node server.js
5. The website should run

For now you can put anything and it will take you to the doctor version.
