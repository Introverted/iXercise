Project for INF132

So from the BitSync, get all of the folders and put them in your own project folder.
This repo has only the files that contains all of the code that we are changing and altering.

In the js folder the funtions.js file is the only js file you will be altering along with the
rest of the html files and js files that are not in the folder. 

Once you have everything in one project folder do this:
1. make sure node.js is installed in your computer [to test try the second step to see if it works]
2. run cmd
3. go to the project folder
4. run >node server.js
5. The website should run

For now you can put anything and it will take you to the doctor version.
